    		<p>Call unto the heavens
               Call unto the deep
               Call for the wind
               Call for the breath of God
               Open your hands
               Lift up your arms
               Look up to the sky
               Open your eyes
               Bend your ears
               Stay still
               Can’t you see?
               The heavens’ door is opening
               The deep is receding
               The wind surrounds you
               The heavenly breath is upon you.</p>

    		<h2>Trek All The Way</h2>
    		<img src="trek.jpg" alt="trek">
    		<p>Some mornings I wish I could just silence the alarm, pull the blankets over my head and make the whole world go away. You’d cover for me, wouldn’t you? You’ve often said the job of a first officer is to make his captain’s life a little easier. Every time you say it I laugh, roll my eyes a little and pretend you’re joking… but secretly, I’m pleased.
              And every time you say it, I try to pretend I’m not falling a little further.
            It’s not in my nature to trust easily. Oh, I trust your training and your experience. I trust you’ll do what you can to protect your people. But what about my people? Are we still separate, or will there really come a day when we are all one and the same?
            Maybe that day will only come when I truly believe it, myself.</p>
